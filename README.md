# Big Data Analysis for Better Breathing: Utilizing Electronic Health Records for Asthma Insights
The World Health Organization (WHO) is concerned about the increasing prevalence of asthma and aims to predict individuals who are at risk and need to take precautions. This project seeks to develop a predictive model to classify individuals into two zones:

Red Zone: Individuals at high risk who need to seek medical attention.
Green Zone: Individuals considered safe with no immediate need for medical concern.
First, we look through the data and find some basic inquiry.
